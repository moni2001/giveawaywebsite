This web app is made in view of helping people earn with the help of their skills.
In simple terms in this website one can giveaway whatever they want like (courses they have, accounts they have,online accounts etc )
and in return earn by the ads placed on the site.
Currently as I am new to django this is the best I could have done.
 I would like you to tell about this idea as well as help in building it more and making it more user friendly.
